                    <p>It tackles the topic of sleeplessness and according to the main rapper of the group, what keeps us sleepless could be what is the most precious to us or what we are most afraid of.

                    <p>mono. is RM’s second solo mixtape following his 2015 release. The cover art of the album incorporates the word ‘playlist’ rather than ‘mixtape’ because the tracks were produced to flow from one song to another. </p>
                    <p>"‘mono,’ can mean black and white. The word mono is great because it also can mean “alone” or “one”. When mono is stuck with another meaning, it is kind of the opposite of its stereotype. I think it’s the best title that can bring all the tracks together." -RM</p>
